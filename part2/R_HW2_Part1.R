  ##Graphing the same graphs as above, with error instead of absolute error, overlapped with a dot for the mean error per test, visually displays what neither of these graphs could show alone. This graph shows that while Slope has distribution from 0.7 to -0.7, the clustering around 0.2 â€“ 0.3 is more intense than might have been perceived with only the scatterplot, meaning Slope was generally overestimated. Volume clearly has clustered around overestimation, and the median highlights this too.
